# PricePredict_ScrapingOLX
This project is an exercise project to improve my skill to scrape data from e-commerce / website. After get the data, I will do data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning for predicting.

# Web Scraping

### The Plan
For this web scraping, I will try to extract mercedes benz used car data (specification and price) from https://olx.co.id. I will use beautifulsoup as the tool to extract olx html. This web scraping is multipage web scraping. From the "mercedes benz" search results, I will extract the title, price, and link to item specifications. After I get them, I will use the link to direct me to item pages to get the car specifications like year, km, varian, model, etc.
